This file contains a list of planned tasks for this project.

* Try to build from source and use the "clip" library (https://github.com/dacap/clip) instead of relying on xclip to be pre-installed
* Either make code cross-platform or create a new branch for a Windows version
* After getting application to work in Windows, create a Windows installer (.msi file)
* Think of ways to optimize/improve/refactor/clean up existing code
* Create a more useful README for users
